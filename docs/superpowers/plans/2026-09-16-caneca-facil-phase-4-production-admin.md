# Caneca Fácil Phase 4 — Production, Shipping Lifecycle and Admin Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Release paid orders safely into print production, complete Melhor Envio label/tracking automation, and turn the current minimal Admin into the operational console defined in the approved MVP spec.

**Architecture:** Production is a separate deterministic domain gated by approved artwork, confirmed payment and a valid print file. Admin reads normalized operational views rather than raw provider payloads. Role-based authorization is enforced in the database/backend, not only in React navigation.

**Tech Stack:** TypeScript, React 19, Vite 8, Vitest, Hono, Supabase Postgres/Auth/Storage/RLS, Melhor Envio API, official WhatsApp notifications.

**Spec:** `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-16-caneca-facil-operational-mvp-design.md`

## Global Constraints

- Production never uses `current_art_version_id`; it uses the immutable approved art pinned by the order.
- Production cannot start unless payment is confirmed and the print file is valid.
- Mockup and print file are different assets with different purposes.
- Every production/shipping transition records who/what changed it and when.
- Role checks must be enforced server/database-side; hiding a button is not authorization.
- Customer-facing notifications are selective; do not spam every internal production transition.

### Task 1: Add Print Files and Production Jobs With Hard Release Gates

**Files:**
- Create: `supabase/migrations/20260916_production.sql`
- Create: `packages/core/src/production.ts`
- Create: `packages/core/src/production.test.ts`
- Create: `apps/api/src/production/print-file.ts`
- Create: `apps/api/src/production/print-file.test.ts`
- Create: `apps/api/src/production/release.ts`
- Create: `apps/api/src/production/release.test.ts`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: `print_files`, `production_jobs`, production statuses `blocked | ready | printing | printed | quality_check | packaging | ready_to_ship | completed | problem`.
- Produces: `canReleaseToProduction(order, payment, art, printFile)` and `releaseOrderToProduction(orderId)`.

- [ ] Write failing core tests proving all three gates are mandatory: approved pinned art, confirmed paid status and valid print file.
- [ ] Create/apply production migration with immutable links to order/project/art version, storage path, dimensions/DPI/template metadata, timestamps and operator IDs.
- [ ] Implement print-file generation from the order-pinned approved art and mug template; persist into a private `print-files` storage bucket created by the migration with admin/service-only access.
- [ ] Implement production release in a transactional boundary so an order cannot be marked `in_production` without a ready production job.
- [ ] Write transition tests rejecting skipped/invalid production steps and preserving `problem` as an exception flag/reason without losing traceability.
- [ ] Run repository verification and Supabase advisors; expect PASS.
- [ ] Commit with `feat: gate and manage print production`.

### Task 2: Complete Melhor Envio Label, Posting and Tracking Lifecycle

**Files:**
- Modify: `apps/api/src/shipping/provider.ts`
- Modify: `apps/api/src/shipping/melhor-envio.ts`
- Modify: `apps/api/src/shipping/melhor-envio.test.ts`
- Create: `apps/api/src/shipping/label.ts`
- Create: `apps/api/src/shipping/label.test.ts`
- Create: `apps/api/src/shipping/webhook.ts`
- Create: `apps/api/src/shipping/webhook.test.ts`
- Modify: `apps/api/src/app.ts`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: label creation/purchase/print-reference flow, tracking code, normalized shipment statuses, idempotent shipping-event ingestion.

- [ ] Write failing tests for create/purchase label, retrieve printable label, duplicate webhook event, posted, delivered and delivery-issue mappings.
- [ ] Implement the complete Melhor Envio label flow only for orders in `ready_to_ship`; repeated calls must reconcile existing provider state before creating duplicate labels.
- [ ] Implement webhook ingestion preserving raw provider event/status and mapping it to normalized shipment state.
- [ ] Trigger WhatsApp notifications only for configured customer-relevant events: ready for shipping, posted/tracking, delivery issue and delivered.
- [ ] Verify provider errors mark the shipment/order attention state without silently rolling back production completion.
- [ ] Run API/repository verification; expect PASS.
- [ ] Commit with `feat: add shipping labels and tracking lifecycle`.

### Task 3: Add Admin Roles and Server-Enforced Permissions

**Files:**
- Create: `supabase/migrations/20260916_admin_roles.sql`
- Modify: `apps/admin/src/auth/AuthGate.tsx`

- Create: `apps/admin/src/services/admin-profile.test.ts`
- Create: `docs/operations/admin-bootstrap.md`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces roles: `administrator`, `sales`, `production`; permission helpers used by routes/actions.
- Database policies enforce the same role boundaries for admin-readable/writeable operational tables.

- [ ] Write failing permission tests for Administrator full access, Sales access to conversations/customers/orders with no integration-secret/production-setting mutation, and Production access only to fulfillment-required data/actions.
- [ ] Create/apply admin-role migration extending the existing `private.admin_users` membership model with `role`, `active`, `display_name`, `created_at`, and `updated_at`; add role-aware helper functions/policies without disabling RLS.
- [ ] Load the signed-in admin profile immediately after Auth session verification and reject authenticated users who are not active admin members.
- [ ] Add permission helpers for UI rendering, but keep privileged mutations protected server/database-side.
- [ ] Document bootstrap exactly: create the first Auth user through Supabase Auth, then insert that `auth.users.id` into `private.admin_users` with role `administrator`; never insert directly into `auth.users` with SQL.
- [ ] Run Admin tests, full repository verification and Supabase security advisor; expect PASS.
- [ ] Commit with `feat: enforce admin operational roles`.

- Create: `apps/admin/src/pages/SettingsPage.test.tsx`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces navigation: `Início | Atendimento | Pedidos | Artes & Produção | Clientes | Modelos | Configurações` filtered by role.

- [ ] Write failing navigation tests for all seven sections and role-specific visibility.
- [ ] Split current two-section `AdminWorkspace` into navigation/shell plus focused pages; preserve existing Project/Gabarito capabilities by moving them into `Artes & Produção` and `Configurações` rather than deleting them.
- [ ] Implement Home operational counters/links only: waiting conversations, human attention, approval, pending PIX, paid waiting production, in production, ready to ship and shipping problems.
- [ ] Implement consistent loading/error/empty states and avoid fetching data for unauthorized hidden sections.
- [ ] Run Admin tests/typecheck/build; expect PASS.

- Displays: conversation stream, text/image/audio/document messages, audio transcription, structured briefing summary, missing information, project/order status and AI/human/paused mode.
- Actions: `assume`, `returnToAi`, `pause` using Phase 1 conversation-control backend.

- [ ] Write failing tests proving takeover changes control state and does not discard project/order context.
- [ ] Implement three-column workspace: list, message/media thread, context panel.
- [ ] Render structured AI extraction only; never expose hidden reasoning/chain-of-thought.
- [ ] Show clear attention reason and current owner/mode at top of each conversation.
- [ ] Run Admin verification; expect PASS.
- [ ] Commit with `feat: add admin conversation workspace`.

**Interfaces:**
- Produces versioned AI attendant settings, editable business knowledge, product/mug definitions, discount rules and safe integration health/config references.

- [ ] Write failing tests proving AI config changes create a new version and can reactivate a prior version rather than destructively overwriting history.
- [ ] Create/apply operational-settings migration for `ai_config_versions` and `business_knowledge_entries`; reuse product/discount tables from Phase 3.
- [ ] Implement settings forms with validation and role restriction to Administrator.
- [ ] Integration status panels may show connected/disconnected/webhook health/last event, but must never return raw secret values to the browser.
- [ ] Implement `apps/api/src/admin/ai-simulator.ts` so it runs the same briefing/conversation orchestration against an isolated test context and has no access to the real WhatsApp send function.
- [ ] Run repository verification and Supabase advisors; expect PASS.
- [ ] Commit with `feat: add admin operational settings`.

### Task 8: Lifecycle Event Coverage and Customer Notifications

**Files:**

- Persists event types required by the spec from `conversation_started` through `delivered`; notification dispatcher maps selected events to WhatsApp messages/templates.

- [ ] Write failing tests for event append/idempotency and notification selection.
- [ ] Create/apply lifecycle-event migration with entity references, occurred timestamp, source and unique external-event key when applicable.
- [ ] Emit events at the existing Phase 1–4 domain boundaries rather than duplicating business state logic.
- [ ] Configure customer notifications for payment confirmed, production started, ready to ship, shipped/tracking, delivery issue and delivered.
- [ ] Confirm lifecycle storage is sufficient for later abandoned project/PIX/post-sale automation without implementing campaign scheduling now.
- [ ] Run repository verification; expect PASS.
- [ ] Commit with `feat: persist commerce lifecycle events`.

### Task 9: Full Operational Acceptance and Security Gate

**Files:**
- Create: `docs/acceptance/operational-mvp.md`

- [ ] Execute one complete real/sandbox scenario: WhatsApp → image/audio → briefing → art → mockup → change → approval → quantity/discount → email/address → Melhor Envio quote → Asaas PIX → payment webhook → print file → production → label/tracking → delivered.
- [ ] Verify the printed file references exactly the art version approved by the customer and pinned by the order.
- [ ] Verify Admin role boundaries with one account per role or equivalent policy-level tests.
- [ ] Replay Meta, PIX and shipping webhooks to confirm idempotency.
- [ ] Run `npm test`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run build`.
- [ ] Run Supabase security and performance advisors; no newly introduced security lint may remain unresolved.
- [ ] Record real operational caveats/provider sandbox limitations in the acceptance document.
- [ ] Commit with `docs: verify Caneca Fácil operational MVP`.

## MVP Exit Gate

The operational MVP is complete only after the approved spec's 20-step end-to-end path is demonstrated and traceable across customer, conversation, project, approved art, order, payment, print file, production job, shipment and lifecycle events.
